Applied a small fix to the string formatter which was calling the wrong string constructor. The string constructor String(const char {{{*}}},...) takes formatted argements, so if you want a string which contains standard format and your not using arguments, you should call the overloaded String(char {{{*}}}, int) constructor so that the format is not processed.  This is exactly what happens in the constructor of the Formatter object.
